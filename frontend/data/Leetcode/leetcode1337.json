      "description": "You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.\n\nA row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:\n\nThe number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.\nBoth rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.\nReturn the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.",

      "explanation": "1. For each row, count the number of soldiers using binary search since soldiers are always at the front.\n2. Create a list of tuples (soldier_count, row_index).\n3. Sort this list first by soldier count, then by row index to break ties.\n4. Return the first k row indices from the sorted list.",
