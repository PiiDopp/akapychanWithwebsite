      "title": "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted",
      "description": "Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index_1] and numbers[index_2] where 1 <= index_1 < index_2 <= numbers.length.\n\nReturn the indices of the two numbers, index_1 and index_2, added by one as an integer array [index_1, index_2] of length 2.\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n\nYour solution must use only constant extra space.",
