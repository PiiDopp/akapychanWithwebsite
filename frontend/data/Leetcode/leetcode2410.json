      "title": "Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers",
      "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array players, where players[i] represents the ability of the i^th player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array trainers, where trainers[j] represents the training capacity of the j^th trainer.\n\nThe ith player can match with the j^th trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the ith player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the j^th trainer can be matched with at most one player.\n\nReturn the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.",

        {
          "input": "players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]",
          "output": "2",
          "explanation": "One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:\n- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.\n- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8. \nIt can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed."

          "input": "players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]",
          "output": "1",
          "explanation": "The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.\nEach player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1."

      "explanation": "1. 將 players 和 trainers 都排序。\n2. 使用雙指針 i, j 遍歷兩個陣列。\n3. 如果 players[i] <= trainers[j]，匹配成功，i 前進，matches 加 1。\n4. j 無論如何前進。\n5. 返回 matches，表示最大匹配數。",
