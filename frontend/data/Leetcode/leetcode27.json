      "description": "Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.\n\nConsider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\n\nChange the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.\nReturn k.\nCustom Judge:\n\nThe judge will test your solution with the following code:\n\nint[] nums = [...]; // Input array\nint val = ...; // Value to remove\nint[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.\n                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.\n\nint k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation\n\nassert k == expectedNums.length;\nsort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums\nfor (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {\n    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];\n}\nIf all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.",

          "explanation": "Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.\nNote that the five elements can be returned in any order.\nIt does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)."

      "explanation": "1. 使用雙指針，slow 指向下一個放置非目標元素的位置，fast 遍歷整個數組。\n2. 遇到不等於 val 的元素時，將其放到 slow 指向的位置並增加 slow。\n3. 返回新的長度 slow，前面部分為去除目標元素後的數組。\n4. 時間複雜度 O(n)，空間複雜度 O(1)。",
