      "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index. \n\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.",

          "input": "citations = [3,0,6,1,5]",
          "output": "3",
          "explanation": "[3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3."

      "explanation": "1. Sort the citations array in descending order.\n2. Iterate through the sorted array with index i and value c.\n3. Check if c >= i + 1. If yes, update h to i + 1.\n4. If not, break the loop since further papers have fewer citations.\n5. Return h, which is the maximum number of papers with at least h citations each.",
