      "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in non-descending order, return the researcher's h-index. \n\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.",

        {
          "input": "citations = [0,1,3,5,6]",
          "output": "3",
          "explanation": "[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3."

      "explanation": "1. 使用二分搜尋法在排序好的 citations 陣列中查找符合 h-index 條件的最小索引。\n2. 如果 citations[mid] 等於剩餘論文數 n - mid，則直接返回 n - mid。\n3. 如果 citations[mid] 小於 n - mid，代表需要更多引用，向右搜索。\n4. 如果 citations[mid] 大於 n - mid，向左搜索。\n5. 返回 n - left 作為最終的 h-index。",
