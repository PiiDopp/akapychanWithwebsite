You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:\n\nAfter you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).",
