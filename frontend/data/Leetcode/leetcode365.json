      "description": "You are given two jugs with capacities x liters and y liters. You have an infinite water supply. Return whether the total amount of water in both jugs may reach target using the following operations:\nFill either jug completely with water.\nCompletely empty either jug.\nPour water from one jug into another until the receiving jug is full, or the transferring jug is empty.",

          "explanation": "Follow these steps to reach a total of 4 liters:\nFill the 5-liter jug (0, 5).\nPour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug, leaving 2 liters (3, 2).\nEmpty the 3-liter jug (0, 2).\nTransfer the 2 liters from the 5-liter jug to the 3-liter jug (2, 0).\nFill the 5-liter jug again (2, 5).\nPour from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug until the 3-liter jug is full. This leaves 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (3, 4).\nEmpty the 3-liter jug. Now, you have exactly 4 liters in the 5-liter jug (0, 4).\nReference: The Die Hard example."
