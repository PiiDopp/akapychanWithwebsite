      "description": "We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows: \n\nI pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).\n\nEvery time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.\n\nYou call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:\n\n-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).\n1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).\n0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).\nReturn the number that I picked.",

      "explanation": "使用二分法搜索從 1 到 n 的範圍：\n1. 設定 left = 1, right = n。\n2. 計算中間值 mid = left + (right - left) // 2。\n3. 呼叫 API guess(mid)。\n   - 若返回 0，mid 即為答案。\n   - 若返回 -1，表示 pick 比 mid 小，將 right 移到 mid - 1。\n   - 若返回 1，表示 pick 比 mid 大，將 left 移到 mid + 1。\n4. 迴圈直到找到答案。這是一個典型的二分搜尋應用。",
