      "description": "Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).\n\nA character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:\n\nFor a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.\nFor an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.\nThis is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:\n\n     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence\n                       |              (binary)\n   --------------------+-----------------------------------------\n            1          |   0xxxxxxx\n            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx\n            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\nx denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.\n\nNote: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.",
