      "description": "Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n\nNote that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.",

      "explanation": "1. 將 intervals 按結束時間升序排序。\n2. 初始化 end 為第一個區間的結束時間，count 記錄不重疊區間數。\n3. 遍歷每個區間，如果當前區間的開始時間 >= end，則更新 end 並增加 count。\n4. 最後需要移除的區間數 = 總區間數 - 不重疊區間數。",
