      "title": "Sort Characters By Frequency",
      "description": "Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.\n\nReturn the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.",

        {
          "input": "s = \"tree\"",
          "output": "\"eert\"",
          "explanation": "'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once. So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore \"eetr\" is also a valid answer."

        {
          "input": "s = \"cccaaa\"",
          "output": "\"aaaccc\"",
          "explanation": "Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both \"cccaaa\" and \"aaaccc\" are valid answers.\nNote that \"cacaca\" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together."

          "input": "s = \"Aabb\"",

      "explanation": "1. 使用 Counter 計算每個字符出現的頻率。\n2. 使用 most_common() 方法按頻率降序排序。\n3. 對每個字符重複 freq 次組合成結果字符串。\n4. 返回排序後的字符串。",
