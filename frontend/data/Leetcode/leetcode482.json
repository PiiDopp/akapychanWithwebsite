      "title": "License Key Formatting",
      "description": "You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.\n\nWe want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.\n\nReturn the reformatted license key.",

        {
          "input": "s = \"5F3Z-2e-9-w\", k = 4",
          "output": " \"5F3Z-2E9W\"",
          "explanation": "The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.\nNote that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed."

          "explanation": "The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above."

      "explanation": "1. 移除原字串中所有 '-' 並將字母轉為大寫。\n2. 計算第一組的長度，如果總長度可以整除 K，則第一組長度為 K，否則為 n % K。\n3. 依次將剩下的字串按照每 K 個字符分組。\n4. 用 '-' 將所有組拼接起來並返回。",
