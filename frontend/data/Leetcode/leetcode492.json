      "description": "A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:\n\nThe area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.\nThe width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.\nThe difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.\nReturn an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.",
      "examples": [
        {
          "input": "area = 4",
          "output": "[2,2]",
          "explanation": "The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].\nBut according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2."

      "explanation": "1. 從目標面積的平方根開始，嘗試尋找最大的寬度 w，使 area % w == 0。\n2. 一旦找到，長度 L 就是 area // w。\n3. 由於從平方根往下尋找，L - W 的差值將是最小的。\n4. 返回 [L, W]。",
