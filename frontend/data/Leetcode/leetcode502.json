      "description": "Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.\n\nYou are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.\n\nInitially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n\nPick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.\n\nThe answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.",
      "examples": [
        {
          "input": "k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]",
          "output": "4",
          "explanation": "Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\nAfter finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\nWith capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\nSince you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\nTherefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4."

      "explanation": "1. 將每個項目以 (capital, profit) 的形式排序，便於按資本需求選擇可行項目。\n2. 使用最大堆（模擬優先隊列）存儲可選項目的 profit。\n3. 對於每次可選項目，將當前資本可承擔的項目全部加入最大堆。\n4. 從最大堆中取出 profit 最大的項目，增加資本 W。\n5. 重複最多 k 次，返回最終資本 W。",
