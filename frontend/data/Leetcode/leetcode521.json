      "title": "Longest Uncommon Subsequence I",
      "description": "Given two strings a and b, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between a and b. If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return -1.\n\nAn uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of exactly one of them.",

        {
          "input": "\"aba\", \"cdc\"",
          "output": "3",
          "explanation": "One longest uncommon subsequence is \"aba\" because \"aba\" is a subsequence of \"aba\" but not \"cdc\". Note that \"cdc\" is also a longest uncommon subsequence."

          "explanation": "Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be -1."

      "explanation": "1. 若 a 與 b 完全相同，則不存在不相同的子序列，返回 -1。\n2. 若 a 與 b 不同，則較長的字串本身就是不相同的子序列，直接返回 max(len(a), len(b))。",
