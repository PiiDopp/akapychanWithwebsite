      "description": "You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:\n\n'A': Absent.\n'L': Late.\n'P': Present.\nThe student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:\n\nThe student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.\nThe student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.\nReturn true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.",

      "explanation": "1. 使用 s.count('A') 計算缺席次數，確保小於等於 1。\n2. 使用 'LLL' not in s 檢查是否有三天連續遲到。\n3. 兩個條件都滿足則返回 True，否則 False。",
