      "description": "Given a list paths of directory info, including the directory path, and all the files with contents in this directory, return all the duplicate files in the file system in terms of their paths. You may return the answer in any order.\n\nA group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.\n\nA single directory info string in the input list has the following format:\n\"root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)\"\nIt means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt) with content (f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content) respectively in the directory \"root/d1/d2/.../dm\". Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.\n\nThe output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:\n\"directory_path/file_name.txt\"",

      "follow up": "Imagine you are given a real file system, how will you search files? DFS or BFS? \nIf the file content is very large (GB level), how will you modify your solution? \nIf you can only read the file by 1kb each time, how will you modify your solution? \nWhat is the time complexity of your modified solution?What is the most time-consuming part and memory-consuming part of it? How to optimize? \nHow to make sure the duplicated files you find are not false positive?",
      "solution": "from collections import defaultdict\n\nclass Solution:\n    def findDuplicate(self, paths):\n        content_map = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        for path in paths:\n            parts = path.split()\n            root = parts[0]\n            for file_info in parts[1:]:\n                name, content = file_info.split('(')\n                content = content[:-1]  # 去掉末尾的 ')'\n                content_map[content].append(root + '/' + name)\n        \n        return [files for files in content_map.values() if len(files) > 1]",
      "explanation": "1. 使用 defaultdict 以文件內容為 key 儲存所有路徑。\n2. 遍歷每個 directory info 字串，拆分成路徑與檔案資訊。\n3. 每個檔案資訊拆成檔名與內容，將完整路徑加入 content_map。\n4. 最後篩選出 content_map 中有超過 1 個檔案的群組，即為重複檔案。",
