You can perform one of two operations on this notepad for each step:\n\nCopy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).\nPaste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.\nGiven an integer n, return the minimum number of operations to get the character 'A' exactly n times on the screen.",
