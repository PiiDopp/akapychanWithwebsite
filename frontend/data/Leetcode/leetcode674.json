      "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.\n\nA continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].",

        {
          "input": "nums = [1,3,5,4,7]",
          "output": "3",
          "explanation": "The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.\nEven though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element 4."

      "explanation": "1. 初始化 max_len 和 cur_len 為 1。\\n2. 從第二個元素開始遍歷，如果 nums[i] > nums[i-1]，增加 cur_len 並更新 max_len。\\n3. 如果不連續遞增，將 cur_len 重置為 1。\\n4. 遍歷結束後返回 max_len。",
