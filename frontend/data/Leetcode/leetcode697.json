      "title": "Degree of an Array",
      "description": "Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.\n\nYour task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.",

        {
          "input": "nums = [1,2,2,3,1]",
          "output": "2",
          "explanation": "The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.\\nOf the subarrays that have the same degree: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2].\\nThe shortest length is 2. So return 2."

          "input": "nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]",
          "output": "6",
          "explanation": "The degree is 3 because the element 2 is repeated 3 times.\\nSo [2,2,3,1,4,2] is the shortest subarray, therefore returning 6."

      "explanation": "1. 遍歷 nums，記錄每個元素的首次出現索引 left、最後出現索引 right 以及出現次數 count。\\n2. 計算整個數組的 degree，即最大頻率。\\n3. 遍歷 count，對於出現次數等於 degree 的元素，計算其子陣列長度 right[num]-left[num]+1，更新最小長度。\\n4. 返回 min_length 即為最短子陣列長度。\\n5. 時間複雜度 O(n)，空間複雜度 O(n)。",
