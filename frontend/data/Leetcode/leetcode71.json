      "description": "You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.\n\nThe rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:\n\nA single period '.' represents the current directory.\nA double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.\nMultiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.\nAny sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.\nThe simplified canonical path should follow these rules:\n\nThe path must start with a single slash '/'.\nDirectories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.\nThe path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.\nThe path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.\nReturn the simplified canonical path.",

      "explanation": "1. 使用 stack 保存有效的目錄名稱。\n2. 將輸入路徑以 '/' 分割成多個部分。\n3. 遍歷每個部分，如果是空字符串或 '.'，則跳過。\n4. 如果是 '..'，彈出 stack 的頂部目錄（如果有的話）。\n5. 否則，將目錄名稱加入 stack。\n6. 最終用 '/' 拼接 stack，並在前面加上 '/' 作為簡化路徑。",
