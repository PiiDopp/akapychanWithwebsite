      "title": "Longest Word in Dictionary",
      "description": "Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.\\nIf there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no answer, return the empty string.\\nNote that the word should be built from left to right with each additional character being added to the end of a previous word.",

        {
          "input": "words = [\"w\",\"wo\",\"wor\",\"worl\",\"world\"]",
          "output": "world",

          "input": "words = [\"a\",\"banana\",\"app\",\"appl\",\"ap\",\"apply\",\"apple\"]",

      "explanation": "1. 將 words 轉成集合方便快速查找。\\n2. 遍歷每個 word，檢查其每個前綴是否存在於集合中。\\n3. 若所有前綴都存在，則判斷該 word 是否比當前 longest 長，或者長度相同但字典序更小。\\n4. 最後返回 longest。",
