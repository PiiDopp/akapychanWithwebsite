      "description": "You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:\n\nPick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.\nReturn the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.",
