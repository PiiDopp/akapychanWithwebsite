      "description": "You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.\n\nReturn the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.",

        {
          "input": "letters = [\"c\",\"f\",\"j\"], target = \"a\"",

      "solution": "class Solution:\n    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters, target):\n        left, right = 0, len(letters) - 1\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if letters[mid] <= target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        return letters[left % len(letters)]",
      "explanation": "1. 使用二分搜尋查找第一個大於 target 的字母。\n2. 初始化左右指標 left 和 right，逐步縮小範圍。\n3. 若中間字母 letters[mid] <= target，則向右查找；否則向左查找。\n4. 最終返回 letters[left % len(letters)]，處理 target 大於所有字母的情況。",
