      "title": "Cracking the Safe",
      "description": "There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].\n\nThe safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.\n\nFor example, the correct password is \"345\" and you enter in \"012345\":\nAfter typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is \"0\", which is incorrect.\nAfter typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is \"01\", which is incorrect.\nAfter typing 2, the most recent 3 digits is \"012\", which is incorrect.\nAfter typing 3, the most recent 3 digits is \"123\", which is incorrect.\nAfter typing 4, the most recent 3 digits is \"234\", which is incorrect.\nAfter typing 5, the most recent 3 digits is \"345\", which is correct and the safe unlocks.\nReturn any string of minimum length that will unlock the safe at some point of entering it.",

          "input": "n = 1, k = 2",

        {
          "input": "n = 2, k = 2",
          "output": "\"01100\"",
          "explanation": "For each possible password:\n- \"00\" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.\n- \"01\" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.\n- \"10\" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.\n- \"11\" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.\nThus \"01100\" will unlock the safe. \"10011\", and \"11001\" would also unlock the safe."

      "explanation": "1. 我們要生成包含所有長度為 n 的數字組合的最短序列，長度為 k^n + n - 1。\n2. 使用 DFS 构造 De Bruijn sequence，每次在當前節點後加入新的數字，若未出現過則遞迴。\n3. 將每個新增的數字逆序加入結果。\n4. 最後返回結果加上初始 n-1 位數，得到最短序列。",
