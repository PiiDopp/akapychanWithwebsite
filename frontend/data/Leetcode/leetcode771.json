      "description": "You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.\n\nLetters are case sensitive, so \"a\" is considered a different type of stone from \"A\".",
      "examples": [
        {
          "input": "jewels = \"aA\", stones = \"aAAbbbb\"",
