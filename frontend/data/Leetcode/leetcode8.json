      "description": "Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.\n\nThe algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:\n\n1.Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (\" \").\n2.Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.\n3.Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.\n4.Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be rounded to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be rounded to 2^31 - 1.\nReturn the integer as the final result.",
