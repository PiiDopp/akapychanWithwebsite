      "title": "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II",
      "description": "Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.\n\nSince it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.\n\nReturn k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.\n\nDo not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.",

          "explanation": "Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)."

          "explanation": "Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)."

      "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        k = 1\n        count = 1\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count = 1\n            if count <= 2:\n                nums[k] = nums[i]\n                k += 1\n        return k",
      "explanation": "1. 初始化一個指針 k 指向可以放置元素的位置，以及一個計數器 count 記錄當前元素出現的次數。\n2. 遍歷數組，如果當前元素等於前一個元素，則 count 加一，否則重置 count 為 1。\n3. 當 count 小於等於 2 時，將當前元素放入 nums[k]，並將 k 前移。\n4. 最終返回 k，表示修改後數組的有效長度。",
