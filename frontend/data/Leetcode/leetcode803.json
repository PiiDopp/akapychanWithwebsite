      "title": "Bricks Falling When Hit",
      "description": "You are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:\nIt is directly connected to the top of the grid, or\nAt least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.\nYou are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).\n\nReturn an array result, where each result[i] is the number of bricks that will fall after the ith erasure is applied.\n\nNote that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.",

          "explanation": "Starting with the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [1,1,1,0]]\nWe erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [0,1,1,0]]\nThe two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:\n[[1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0]]\nHence the result is [2]."
