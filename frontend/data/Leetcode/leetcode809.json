      "description": "Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling. For example: \n\n\"hello\" -> \"heeellooo\"\n\"hi\" -> \"hiiii\"\nIn these strings like \"heeellooo\", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: \"h\", \"eee\", \"ll\", \"ooo\".\n\nYou are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.\n\nFor example, starting with \"hello\", we could do an extension on the group \"o\" to get \"hellooo\", but we cannot get \"helloo\" since the group \"oo\" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like \"ll\" -> \"lllll\" to get \"helllllooo\". If s = \"helllllooo\", then the query word \"hello\" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = \"hello\" -> \"hellooo\" -> \"helllllooo\" = s.\nReturn the number of query strings that are stretchy.",

      "explanation": "1. 定義 valid(word) 來判斷單詞是否可以延展成 s。\n2. 使用雙指標 i, j 遍歷 s 與 word，計算相同字母連續的長度。\n3. 若 word 中的連續長度大於 s 的連續長度，或 s 的連續長度 <3 且不等於 word 的連續長度，返回 False。\n4. 若成功遍歷整個字串，返回 True。\n5. 對 words 中所有單詞計算 valid，統計符合條件的數量。",
