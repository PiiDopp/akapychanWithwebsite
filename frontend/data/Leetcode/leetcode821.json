          "explanation": "The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).\nThe closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.\nFor index 1, it is abs(1 - 3) = 2.\nFor index 4, it is 1 (tie between indices 3 and 5).\nFor index 8, it is abs(8 - 6) = 2."
