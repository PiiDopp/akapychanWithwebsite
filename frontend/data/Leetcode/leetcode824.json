      "description": "You are given a string sentence that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.\n\nWe would like to convert the sentence to \"Goat Latin\" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:\n\nIf a word begins with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append \"ma\" to the end of the word.\nFor example, the word \"apple\" becomes \"applema\".\nIf a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add \"ma\".\nFor example, the word \"goat\" becomes \"oatgma\".\nAdd one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.\nFor example, the first word gets \"a\" added to the end, the second word gets \"aa\" added to the end, and so on.\nReturn the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin.",

      "explanation": "1. 將句子拆分成單詞列表。\n2. 遍歷單詞列表，對每個單詞判斷首字母是否為元音。\n3. 若是元音，直接加 'ma'；若是輔音，將首字母移到末尾並加 'ma'。\n4. 在單詞末尾添加 i 個 'a'，i 為單詞在句子中的索引（從 1 開始）。\n5. 最後用空格將處理後的單詞連接成句子並返回。",
