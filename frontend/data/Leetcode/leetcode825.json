      "description": "There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.\n\nA Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:\n\nage[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7\nage[y] > age[x]\nage[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100\nOtherwise, x will send a friend request to y.\n\nNote that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.\n\nReturn the total number of friend requests made.",
