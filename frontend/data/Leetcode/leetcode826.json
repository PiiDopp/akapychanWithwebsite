      "description": "You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:\n\ndifficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and\nworker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).\nEvery worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.\n\nFor example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.\nReturn the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.",
