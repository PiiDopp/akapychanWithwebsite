      "description": "In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.\n\nFor example, a string like s = \"abbxxxxzyy\" has the groups \"a\", \"bb\", \"xxxx\", \"z\", and \"yy\".\n\nA group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group.\n\nA group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.\n\nReturn the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.",
