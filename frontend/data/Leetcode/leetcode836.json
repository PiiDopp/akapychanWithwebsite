      "description": "An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.\n\nTwo rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.\n\nGiven two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.",

      "explanation": "1. 判斷矩形 rec1 和 rec2 是否不重疊的條件：\n   - rec1 左邊界 >= rec2 右邊界\n   - rec1 右邊界 <= rec2 左邊界\n   - rec1 下邊界 >= rec2 上邊界\n   - rec1 上邊界 <= rec2 下邊界\n2. 如果以上條件成立，矩形不重疊；否則重疊。\n3. 使用 not 將不重疊條件取反，即可得到是否重疊。",
