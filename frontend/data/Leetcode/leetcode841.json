      "description": "There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.\n\nWhen you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.\n\nGiven an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.",

          "explanation": "We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.\nWe then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.\nWe then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.\nWe then visit room 3.\nSince we were able to visit every room, we return true."
