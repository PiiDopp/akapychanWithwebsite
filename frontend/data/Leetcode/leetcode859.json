      "description": "Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.\n\nSwapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].\n\nFor example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in \"abcd\" results in \"cbad\".",

      "explanation": "1. 如果 s 與 goal 長度不同，直接返回 False。\n2. 如果 s 與 goal 相同，只有當 s 中有重複字元時才可進行交換，返回 True。\n3. 找出 s 與 goal 中不同的位置 diffs。\n4. 若 diffs 恰好有兩個元素且互換後相等，返回 True，否則 False。",
