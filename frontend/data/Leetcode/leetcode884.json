      "title": "Uncommon Words from Two Sentences",
      "description": "A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.\nA word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.\n\nGiven two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.",
      "examples": [
        {
          "input": "s1 = \"this apple is sweet\", s2 = \"this apple is sour\"",
          "output": "[\"sweet\",\"sour\"]",
          "explanation": "The word \"sweet\" appears only in s1, while the word \"sour\" appears only in s2."
        },
        {
          "input": "s1 = \"apple apple\", s2 = \"banana\"",
          "output": "[\"banana\"]"
        }
      ],
      "constraints": "1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200\ns1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.\ns1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.\nAll the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.",
      "solution": "class Solution(object):\n    def uncommonFromSentences(self, A, B):\n        \"\"\"\n        :type A: str\n        :type B: str\n        :rtype: List[str]\n        \"\"\"\n        from collections import Counter\n        count = Counter(A.split()) + Counter(B.split())\n        return [word for word, freq in count.items() if freq == 1]",
      "explanation": "1. 使用 split() 將兩個句子分割成單詞列表。\n2. 使用 Counter 計算每個單詞出現的次數，兩個句子的 Counter 相加得到總次數。\n3. 遍歷計數字典，挑選出出現次數為 1 的單詞，即為不常見的單詞。",
