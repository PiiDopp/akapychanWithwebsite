      "description": "An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers where:\n\nEvery integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2^n - 1],\nThe first integer is 0,\nAn integer appears no more than once in the sequence,\nThe binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and\nThe binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.\nGiven an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.",
