      "description": "Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.\n\nThe span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.\n\nFor example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.\nAlso, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.\nImplement the StockSpanner class:\n\nStockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.\nint next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.",

      "explanation": "1. 使用 stack 來儲存價格與其對應的 span，初始為空。\n2. 每次 next(price) 時，先設 span = 1，表示今天至少為 1 天。\n3. 當 stack 不為空且 stack 最上層價格 <= price 時，將該元素彈出並將其 span 累加到今天的 span。\n4. 將 (price, span) 推入 stack。\n5. 返回 span，即今天的股票跨度。",
