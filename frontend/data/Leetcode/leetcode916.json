      "description": "You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.\nA string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.\nFor example, \"wrr\" is a subset of \"warrior\" but is not a subset of \"world\".\nA string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.\nReturn an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.",
